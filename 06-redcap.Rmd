# REDCap {#redcap-data}

I have collected some experience building databases in REDCap.[@harrisREDCapConsortiumBuilding2019] Genereally, it is a very effective tool, that is relatively easy to learn and use. There is a lot of material available online, that I will try and link to (and have no intentions competing with that), but here I will try to collect some tips and tricks for collecting data in an efficient way and in a Danish setting.
