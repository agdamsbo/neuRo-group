In the group we mainly work in R and use REDCap(Harris et al. 2009) (Harris et al. 2019) for data collection. In this book I will include workflow examples on how to work with data from REDCap in R, but also share tips to buiilding a database in REDCap, a task many PhD-student may only experience once, and hence the individual experience is limited. The book is build using the bookdown package(Xie 2022) using the bookdown-demo. Source The source files are hosted on GitHub. You are welcome to contribute through comments, PRs or you can write an email to the author. Literature "],["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction to R", " Chapter 1 Introduction to R Welcome to R! The first thing to do is to get an idea of how using are (or any other programming language) is fundamentally different to eg using something like LibreOffice Calc or Excel. Go to your preferred search platform and search for something like “basic r course” and you can get going. After you have the basic knowledge and a vocabulary on R, you are ready to start searching for solutions to your problems. For further help, your are always welcome to ask others in the group or you can join the neuRo-R-group on Matrix. Just follow the link. "],["workflow.html", "Chapter 2 Workflow in data management 2.1 Getting started 2.2 Downloading data 2.3 Notes", " Chapter 2 Workflow in data management Working with data analysis in the research group, and in general it is highly advisable to keep data at a secure server (like REDCap) and only working on temporary data on your machine only saving outcome and aggregated tables if necessary. In the following is a guide to get started working on REDCap data in R using the REDCapR-package.(Beasley 2022) Following the package link provides an extensive description on workflows and functionality. However, sometimes less is more, and so goes. 2.1 Getting started Before you are able to get any data out of REDCap, make sure that you are able to get in. After you are logged in, make sure, that you have permissions to get an API-key. The API-key is a alpha-numeric key used to verify yourself to the REDCap-server, when requesting data export. library(REDCapR) # Returns the variables &quot;record_id&quot; and &quot;age&quot;. ds_some_vars &lt;- redcap_read( redcap_uri = &quot;https://redcap.au.dk/api/&quot;, # This is the address for projects at the AU-server token = &quot;YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE&quot;, fields = c(&quot;record_id&quot;, &quot;age&quot;) )$data # Return only records with IDs of 1 and 4 ds_some_rows &lt;- redcap_read( redcap_uri = &quot;https://redcap.au.dk/api/&quot;, # This is the address for projects at the AU-server token = &quot;YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE&quot;, records = c(1, 4) )$data To get a full list of available variable names, you can either go through the codebook on REDCap, or you can try the following, but be aware, that the resulting vector of variable names can get a little long and confusing. # Returns a vector of names of all accessible variables. variable_names &lt;- redcap_read( redcap_uri = &quot;https://redcap.au.dk/api/&quot;, # This is the address for projects at the AU-server token = &quot;YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE&quot; )$data |&gt; colnames() Note that the ’ |&gt; ’ is the pipe-operator native to R since version 4.1. It works similarly to the ’ %&gt;% ’ from the tidyverse. 2.2 Downloading data When using a longitudinal project design or the “repeated instruments” functionality within REDcap, the dataset will be structured in “long” format with several rows for each ID (one for each “event” and “instance” of repeated instrument). Depending on the analysis, the data set can be converted to a “wide” format, with only one row per ID. The pivot_wider() from the tidyr pakckage can be used, but the most straight-forward approach is to only download the data needed and use the join_left() function to merge data. When handling data from repeated instruments the pivot_wider() can be used first. Here is an example on how to export data on RBANS and cleaning the data for plotting. ds &lt;- redcap_read( redcap_uri = &quot;https://redcap.au.dk/api/&quot;, # This is the address for projects at the AU-server token = &quot;YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE&quot;, records = c(1:35), # Downloading data from ID 1 to 35. forms = &quot;rbans&quot;, # Downloading only the RBANS instrument event = c(&quot;3_months_arm_1&quot;, # Specifying only to download 3 and 12 months data &quot;12_months_arm_1&quot;) )$data |&gt; select( # Selecting variables to keep c(&quot;record_id&quot;, &quot;redcap_event_name&quot;, ends_with(c(&quot;_is&quot;,&quot;_lo&quot;,&quot;_up&quot;,&quot;_per&quot;))) # I only want index scores, lower and upper CIs and percentile. ) |&gt; na.omit() # Omitting IDs with missing data. head(ds, n = 5) # Showing only the first 5 rows Further examples and scripts can be found in the ENIGMA code repository. 2.3 Notes As a standard only export privileges should be given to an API-key and only to de-identified data. Full access with both read and write access is possible but should be highly restricted. API-keys should be regenerated regularly.

The book is written by Thanh Phan (whom Anne has worked with(“Can Helicopters Solve the Transport Dilemma for Patients With Symptoms of Large-Vessel Occlusion Stroke in Intermediate Density Areas? A Simulation Model Based on Real Life Data,” n.d.)), and is still a work in progress. I (andreas) have made a publishable fork of the work, which can be accessed here. Just note that not all examples are working do to missing data sets or references to non-maintained packages. 3.2 More Advanced R The Advanced R course at the PhD School at AU is based on this book: Advanced R Course by Florian Privé. This is a really good collection of more advanced R-use with focus on using the tidyverse-packages and working efficiently. A lot of other external references are also included for further reading. 3.3 PhD Biostat course CheatSheet As part of the PhD BioStat course, the teacher, Eric Parner is providing a Data Analysis reference overview, or CheatSheet. Biostat CheatSheet - click to download - source: Eric Parner, AU 3.4 On geocomputation Introduction to geocomputational work in R. link 3.5 Inspiration for plots Data can be visualised in many ways. Deciding on the best plot can be difficult. Here are some sources of insppiration: Cheatsheet on Grafics Principles. 3.6 On People Analytics A “Handbook of Regression Modeling in People”. The book is very recent (last update on 19 August 2022), with lots of example code and data. Code examples in both R, Python and Julia. All free and open source languages used in data analytics. Read it here. 3.7 Statistacal learning The field of statistical learning or machine learning is increasingly popular. The PhD School at AU offers courses on applied SL/ML, and here follows just a short introduction. The mandatory book on SL/ML in R is “An introduction to statistical learning with applications in R”(Gareth James et al. 2021). Here is a short review: Tee book can be downloaded for free as a PDF and is highly recommended. Also, there is a lecture series on youtube with the authors on the first edition of the book (currently in second edition).

Below are suggestions on how to use some of the functions in your work. 4.1 Install remotes::install_github(&quot;agdamsbo/stRoke&quot;) 4.2 Events and repeated instruments The package includes the function read_redcap_tables(), which helps in handling the castellated REDCap data set format in projects utilizing events and repeated instruments. In {#workflow}, a structured approached is recommended as per the documentation provided by library(REDCapR)(Beasley 2022). This is fine, but can sometimes be a little inconvenient. The read_redcap_tables() works by wrapping REDCapR::redcap_read() and REDCapRITS::REDCap_split()followed by a bit of clean-up. stRoke::read_redcap_tables(redcap_uri = &quot;https://redcap.au.dk/api/&quot;, token = &quot;YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE&quot;, forms = c(&quot;rbans&quot;, &quot;mrs&quot;), fields = c(&quot;record_id&quot;, &quot;age&quot;, &quot;class_toast&quot;)) Literature "],["redcap-data.html", "Chapter 5 REDCap", " Chapter 5 REDCap I have collected some experience building databases in REDCap.(Harris et al. 2019) Genereally, it is a very effective tool, that is relatively easy to learn and use.
