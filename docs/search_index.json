The first part is concerned with recommendations for the new R-user on how to get started, including bookmarks to packages used within the group. In the last part, the package {stRoke} is introduced, which is a small toolbox of collected tools for easier data management and analysis. And then a reference to the REDCap R Handbook is provided to help on getting started with using REDCap data in R. The author This book was created and is maintained by Andreas G Damsbo (GitHub, ORCiD), clinical researcher and PhD-student at Aarhus University and Aarhus University Hospital working in clinical stroke research. Source This book and its content is open source and shared under the AGPL-3 license. The source files are hosted on GitHub. You are welcome to contribute through comments, PRs or you can write an email. The book is build using the bookdown package(Xie 2022) using the bookdown-demo. Literature "],["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction to R", " Chapter 1 Introduction to R Welcome to R! The first thing to do is to get an idea of how using are (or any other programming language) is fundamentally different to eg using something like LibreOffice Calc or Excel. Go to your preferred search platform and search for something like “basic r course” and you can get going. After you have the basic knowledge and a vocabulary on R, you are ready to start searching for solutions to your problems. For further help, your are always welcome to ask others in the group or you can join the neuRo-R-group on Matrix. Just follow the link.

The book is written by Thanh Phan (whom Anne has worked with(“Can Helicopters Solve the Transport Dilemma for Patients With Symptoms of Large-Vessel Occlusion Stroke in Intermediate Density Areas? A Simulation Model Based on Real Life Data,” n.d.)), and is still a work in progress. I (andreas) have made a publishable fork of the work, which can be accessed here. Just note that not all examples are working do to missing data sets or references to non-maintained packages. 2.2 More Advanced R The Advanced R course at the PhD School at AU is based on this book: Advanced R Course by Florian Privé. This is a really good collection of more advanced R-use with focus on using the tidyverse-packages and working efficiently. A lot of other external references are also included for further reading. 2.3 PhD Biostat course CheatSheet As part of the PhD BioStat course, the teacher, Eric Parner is providing a Data Analysis reference overview, or CheatSheet. Biostat CheatSheet - click to download - source: Eric Parner, AU 2.4 On geocomputation Introduction to geocomputational work in R. link 2.5 Inspiration for plots Data can be visualised in many ways. Deciding on the best plot can be difficult. Here are some sources of insppiration: Cheatsheet on Grafics Principles. 2.6 On People Analytics A “Handbook of Regression Modeling in People”. The book is very recent (last update on 19 August 2022), with lots of example code and data. Code examples in both R, Python and Julia. All free and open source languages used in data analytics. Read it here. 2.7 Statistacal learning The field of statistical learning or machine learning is increasingly popular. The PhD School at AU offers courses on applied SL/ML, and here follows just a short introduction. The mandatory book on SL/ML in R is “An introduction to statistical learning with applications in R”(Gareth James et al. 2021). Here is a short review: Tee book can be downloaded for free as a PDF and is highly recommended. Also, there is a lecture series on youtube with the authors on the first edition of the book (currently in second edition). 2.8 Finalfit The finalfit package provides functions that help you quickly create elegant final results tables and plots when modelling in R. These can easily be exported as Word documents, PDFs, or html files. 2.9 ggpubr https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/ Literature "],["stRoke.html", "Chapter 3 stRoke 3.1 Install 3.2 Events and repeated instruments", " Chapter 3 stRoke The package library(stRoke)(Damsbo 2022) is a collection of function to help in data management and analysis. Below are suggestions on how to use some of the functions in your work. 3.1 Install remotes::install_github(&quot;agdamsbo/stRoke&quot;) 3.2 Events and repeated instruments The package includes the function read_redcap_tables(), which helps in handling the castellated REDCap data set format in projects utilizing events and repeated instruments. In {#workflow}, a structured approached is recommended as per the documentation provided by library(REDCapR)(Beasley 2022). This is fine, but can sometimes be a little inconvenient. The read_redcap_tables() works by wrapping REDCapR::redcap_read() and REDCapRITS::REDCap_split()followed by a bit of clean-up. stRoke::read_redcap_tables(redcap_uri = &quot;https://redcap.au.dk/api/&quot;, token = &quot;YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE&quot;, forms = c(&quot;rbans&quot;, &quot;mrs&quot;), fields = c(&quot;record_id&quot;, &quot;age&quot;, &quot;class_toast&quot;)) Literature "],["redcap.html", "Chapter 4 REDCap", " Chapter 4 REDCap Working with data in our group, most data is collected and stored in REDCap databases. From REDCap data can be exported as spreadsheets and stored on a computer or in a safe cloud. A different approach, is to access data directly from R without downloading and storing data on your computer, which is preferable for obvious reasons. I am currently working on a REDCap R Handbook covering interfacing with REDCap from R. The goal is to cover the basics of accessing REDCap from R, data management, and how to build a database in R. Go and have a look, and don’t hesitate to suggest additional areas or functionality to cover.
