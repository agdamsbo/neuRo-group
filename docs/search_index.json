The first thing to do is to get an idea of how using are (or any other programming language) is fundamentally different to eg using something like LibreOffice Calc or Excel. Go to your preferred search platform and search for something like “basic r course” and you can get going. After you have the basic knowledge and a vocabulary on R, you are ready to start searching for solutions to your problems. For further help, your are always welcome to ask others in the group or you can join the neuRo-R-group on Matrix. Just follow the link.

In the following is a guide to get started working on REDCap data in R using the REDCapR-package.(Beasley 2022) Following the package link provides an extensive description on workflows and functionality. However, sometimes less is more, and so goes. 3.1 Getting started Before you are able to get any data out of REDCap, make sure that you are able to get in. After you are logged in, make sure, that you have permissions to get an API-key. The API-key is a alpha-numeric key used to verify yourself to the REDCap-server, when requesting data export. # Returns the variables &quot;record_id&quot; and &quot;age&quot;. ds_some_vars &lt;- redcap_read( redcap_uri = &quot;https://redcap.au.dk/api/&quot;, # This is the address for projects at the AU-server token = &quot;YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE&quot;, fields = c(&quot;record_id&quot;, &quot;age&quot;) )$data # Return only records with IDs of 1 and 4 ds_some_rows &lt;- redcap_read( redcap_uri = &quot;https://redcap.au.dk/api/&quot;, # This is the address for projects at the AU-server token = &quot;YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE&quot;, records = c(1, 4) )$data To get a full list of available variable names, you can either go through the codebook on REDCap, or you can try the following, but be aware, that the resulting vector of variable names can get a little long and confusing. # Returns a vector of names of all accessible variables. variable_names &lt;- redcap_read( redcap_uri = &quot;https://redcap.au.dk/api/&quot;, # This is the address for projects at the AU-server token = &quot;YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE&quot; )$data |&gt; colnames() Note that the ’ |&gt; ’ is the pipe-operator native to R since version 4.1. It works similarly to the ’ %&gt;% ’ from the tidyverse. 3.2 Notes As a standard only export privileges should be given to an API-key and only to de-identified data. Full access with both read and write access is possible but should be highly restricted. API-keys should be regenerated regularly.

This is a really good collection of more advanced R-use with focus on using the tidyverse-packages and working efficiently. A lot of other external references are also included for further reading. 4.2 PhD Biostat course CheatSheet As part of the PhD BioStat course, the teacher, Eric Parner is providing a Data Analysis reference overview, or CheatSheet.
