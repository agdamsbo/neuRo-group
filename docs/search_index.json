The first thing to do is to get an idea of how using are (or any other programming language) is fundamentally different to eg using something like LibreOffice Calc or Excel. Go to your preferred search platform and search for something like “basic r course” and you can get going. After you have the basic knowledge and a vocabulary on R, you are ready to start searching for solutions to your problems.

In the following is a guide to get started working on REDCap data in R using the REDCapR-package.(Beasley 2022) Following the package link provides an extensive description on workflows and functionality. However, sometimes less is more, and so goes. 3.1 Getting started Before you are able to get any data out of REDCap, make sure that you are able to get in. After you are logged in, make sure, that you have permissions to get an API-key. The API-key is a alpha-numeric key used to verify yourself to the REDCap-server, when requesting data export. library(REDCapR) # Returns the variables &quot;record_id&quot; and &quot;age&quot;. ds_some_vars &lt;- redcap_read( redcap_uri = &quot;https://redcap.au.dk/api/&quot;, # This is the address for projects at the AU-server token = &quot;YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE&quot;, fields = c(&quot;record_id&quot;, &quot;age&quot;) )$data # Return only records with IDs of 1 and 4 ds_some_rows &lt;- redcap_read( redcap_uri = &quot;https://redcap.au.dk/api/&quot;, # This is the address for projects at the AU-server token = &quot;YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE&quot;, records = c(1, 4) )$data To get a full list of available variable names, you can either go through the codebook on REDCap, or you can try the following, but be aware, that the resulting vector of variable names can get a little long and confusing. # Returns a vector of names of all accessible variables. variable_names &lt;- redcap_read( redcap_uri = &quot;https://redcap.au.dk/api/&quot;, # This is the address for projects at the AU-server token = &quot;YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE&quot; )$data |&gt; colnames() Note that the ’ |&gt; ’ is the pipe-operator native to R since version 4.1. It works similarly to the ’ %&gt;% ’ from the tidyverse. 3.2 Downloading data When using a longitudinal project design or the “repeated instruments” functionality within REDcap, the dataset will be structured in “long” format with several rows for each ID (one for each “event” and “instance” of repeated instrument). Depending on the analysis, the data set can be converted to a “wide” format, with only one row per ID. The pivot_wider() from the tidyr pakckage can be used, but the most straight-forward approach is to only download the data needed and use the join_left() function to merge data. When handling data from repeated instruments the pivot_wider() can be used first. Here is an example on how to export data on RBANS and cleaning the data for plotting. ds &lt;- redcap_read( redcap_uri = &quot;https://redcap.au.dk/api/&quot;, # This is the address for projects at the AU-server token = &quot;YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE&quot;, records = c(1:35), # Downloading data from ID 1 to 35. forms = &quot;rbans&quot;, # Downloading only the RBANS instrument event = c(&quot;3_months_arm_1&quot;, # Specifying only to download 3 and 12 months data &quot;12_months_arm_1&quot;) )$data |&gt; select( # Selecting variables to keep c(&quot;record_id&quot;, &quot;redcap_event_name&quot;, ends_with(c(&quot;_is&quot;,&quot;_lo&quot;,&quot;_up&quot;,&quot;_per&quot;))) # I only want index scores, lower and upper CIs and percentile. ) |&gt; na.omit() # Omitting IDs with missing data. head(ds, n = 5) # Showing only the first 5 rows Further examples and scripts can be found in the ENIGMA code repository. 3.3 Notes As a standard only export privileges should be given to an API-key and only to de-identified data. Full access with both read and write access is possible but should be highly restricted. API-keys should be regenerated regularly.

The book is written by Thanh Phan (whom Anne has worked with(Behrndtz et al. 2022)), and is still a work in progress. I (andreas) have made a publishable fork of the work, which can be accessed here. Just note that not all examples are working do to missing data sets or references to non-maintained packages. 4.2 More Advanced R The Advanced R course at the PhD School at AU is based on this book: Advanced R Course by Florian Privé. This is a really good collection of more advanced R-use with focus on using the tidyverse-packages and working efficiently. A lot of other external references are also included for further reading. 4.3 PhD Biostat course CheatSheet As part of the PhD BioStat course, the teacher, Eric Parner is providing a Data Analysis reference overview, or CheatSheet.

The PhD School at AU offers courses on applied SL/ML, and here follows just a short introduction. 5.1 The Book The mandatory book on SL/ML in R is “An introduction to statistical learning with applications in R”(Gareth James et al. 2021). Here is a short review: “An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R” is a popular textbook on statistical learning and regression methods. The book is written by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani, all renowned researchers in the field of statistics and machine learning. The book provides a thorough and rigorous treatment of the topic, making it well-suited for students and practitioners who are looking to gain a deep understanding of the methods used in statistical learning. It covers a wide range of topics, including linear regression, classification, cross-validation, and regularization, and provides a strong foundation in these areas. One of the standout features of the book is its use of the R programming language to illustrate the concepts discussed. R is a widely-used language in the field of statistics and data analysis, and the authors do an excellent job of showing how to use R to implement the techniques discussed in the book. Overall, “An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R” is an excellent resource for anyone looking to learn about statistical learning and regression methods. Its clear explanations and use of R make it a valuable resource for students and practitioners alike.” — chatGPT Tee book can be downloaded for free as a PDF and is highly recommended.
