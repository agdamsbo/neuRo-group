# stRoke {#stRoke}

I (andreas) have collected a few useful custom functions in a package, `library(stRoke)`.

The source can be accessed here, and below will follow a few examples on hov to use the package. At the source, documentation is also available.

## Install

```{r stRoke-install, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("agdamsbo/stRoke")
```
