# Preamble {-}

This book started as collection of bookmarks for learning and working in R with health data as part of a R usergroup in our research group.
The first part is concerned with recommendations for the new R-user on how to get started, including bookmarks to packages used within the group.
In the last part, the package `{stRoke}` is introduced, which is a small toolbox of collected tools for easier data management and analysis. And then a reference to the [REDCap R Handbook](https://agdamsbo.github.io/redcap-r-handbook/) is provided to help on getting started with using REDCap data in R.
